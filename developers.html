                            From an early age, Mark found himself particularly drawn to chamber theatre and journalism. That is why his choice to study Computer Science as a college major was a thunderbolt to many, including his parents. While incredibly dubious about his first classes, he found himself inclined towards specializations such as Data Science and Business Analytics, although he still considers himself a novice in both.

                            In his leisure time, Mark enjoys watching movies and writing poetry, as expected given his background. He also likes to curate playlists and do mindful exercises as a form of self-management. His biggest dream is to travel all the places in the world as long as he can, with a tasteful liking for the aesthetics of the Lombardy region in Northern Italy and the Manhattan apartments in The Big Apple.
